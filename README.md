This app collects the users "Principal" (amount of money available to be invensted), "Period" (times per year that interest will be compounded), "Interest Percentage" (estimated annual interest rate), and "Years" (years planned to save).
The app will auto return the amount of "Interest Accumulated" along with the "Total" at then end of the calculation.
